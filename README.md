## what is Web Design?

see [Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/web-design)

> refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.

## Web Design vs. Web Development?

First lets see some topics about design vs programming, many people confuse web design and web development. The differences are as follows:

- Web design focuses on the feel and look of a website while web development focuses on creating the back end of a website.
- Web designers use JavaScript, CSS and html as their main tools while web developers use ruby, C, Python, PHP and .NET as their main tools.
- A web designer is more artistic in his skills while a developer is more technical or a linear thinker.
- As a web designer, you have to be competent at color scheming, information flow and graphic design but as a developer, you should have mainly hands on programming skills.
- Web designers are more about creating a user experience that is appealing to web surfers while web developers are more involved in creating the user interface.

## Implementing A UI Design From Scratch (Creating holberton-headphones page)

this project implement a design from scratch, usign this figma starter file [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/gkWRcFqkwtruWZgSfnnHF0/Holberton-School-Headphone-company?node-id=0%3A1)

There are many ways to build a layout in HTML & CSS, and every developer has his own way of doing it. Getting to know the thinking process inside a Front End Developer mind is extremely useful, as it gives us different perspectives on how to solve certain problems.

The following were the key steps

- **Element by element**: breaking design elements into homogenized components, design systems make the whole process more efficient. Planning, designing, testing and coding are all streamlined to reduce wasting time.

- **Take a starter base**: Use older start point files to improve time to final result.
- **Color palette**: Identify your chosen shades and hues for every color you use repeatedly, set a primary branding colors, but also pay attention to secondary colors. (what color is your text? Your links? Special buttons? Backgrounds?)
- **Last advice**:  always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.
